# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## We were tasked with refracting the code of a messy website HTML and CSS.

### Let's start with the easy stuff, HTML
    
    The purpose of this assignment was not to change a bunch of the assets in this files HTML page. Instead we were taksed to clean up the redundent repeating code in the website.
    
    The best place to start for me was to change the four-hundred div tags into different more specific tags. 

    The next task I took upon myself was to comment out exactly what the function of the lines of code I was provided with did. 
    
    Then I decided it was important to give my website a better title, so I did so by changing the title tag. 

### Onto CSS

    The CSS had a lot of repeating code that all had the same intentions. The easiest way I knew to shorten that code up was to create different classes for each of the sections.

    I decided to group the content secition, which included the Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and the Social Media Marketing all into one class rather than three. I titled this class "content-section"

    I repeated this step to simplify the CSS code in the section that included Brand Awareness, Cost Management, and Lead Generation. I named this class "benefit-section".

### Back into HTML to make my changes official

    I had to go back and define my newly established classes into my HTML page. 

    After doing this proccess, I realized that the links in my header were no longer able to track their end destination. I resolved this problem by resassigning my <a> tags to the "content-section" class.

    This cleaned up my code a large amount and kept the original website in tact.
